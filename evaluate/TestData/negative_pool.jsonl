FGLP represents the user location data\nas relative points in an abstract 2D space, which enables learning across\ndifferent physical spaces. The model merges Bidirectional Long Short-Term\nMemory (BiLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), where BiLSTM learns\nthe speed and direction of the mobile users, and CNN learns information such as\nuser movement preferences. FGLP uses federated learning to protect user privacy\nand reduce bandwidth consumption.

While several methods\nhave been proposed to achieve personalization, they are typically limited to a\nsingle local device, which may incur bias or overfitting since data in a single\ndevice is extremely limited. In this paper, we attempt to realize\npersonalization beyond a single client. The motivation is that during FL, there\nmay exist many clients with similar data distribution, and thus the\npersonalization performance could be significantly boosted if these similar\nclients can cooperate with each other.

On the other hand, black-box models are better suited to\ncapture nonlinear building dynamics and thus can often achieve better accuracy,\nbut they require a lot of data and might not follow the laws of physics, a\nproblem that is particularly common for neural network (NN) models. To counter\nthis known generalization issue, physics-informed NNs have recently been\nintroduced, where researchers introduce prior knowledge in the structure of NNs\nto ground them in known underlying physical laws and avoid classical NN\ngeneralization issues.\n  In this work, we present a novel physics-informed NN architecture, dubbed\nPhysically Consistent NN (PCNN), which only requires past operational data and\nno engineering overhead, including prior knowledge in a linear module running\nin parallel to a classical NN.

We achieve this by first leveraging a continuous-time framework\nfor designing fixed-time stable dynamical systems, and later providing a\nconsistent discretization strategy, such that the equivalent discrete-time\nalgorithm tracks the optimizer in a practically fixed number of iterations. We\nalso provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence behavior of the proposed\ngradient flows, and their robustness to additive disturbances for a range of\nfunctions obeying strong convexity, strict convexity, and possibly nonconvexity\nbut satisfying the Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz inequality. We also show that the\nregret bound on the convergence rate is constant by virtue of the fixed-time\nconvergence. The hyperparameters have intuitive interpretations and can be\ntuned to fit the requirements on the desired convergence rates.

This\ntop-down approach creates a tension between exploration range and search space\ncomplexity, especially when also exploring data layout transformations such as\nim2col, channel packing or padding.\n  In this work, we propose a new approach to this problem. We created a\nbottom-up method that allows the joint transformation of both compuation and\ndata layout based on the found embedding. By formulating the embedding as a\nconstraint satisfaction problem over the scalar dataflow, every possible\nembedding solution is contained in the search space. Adding additional\nconstraints and optmization targets to the solver generates the subset of\npreferable solutions.\n  An evaluation using the VTA hardware accelerator with the Baidu DeepBench\ninference benchmark shows that our approach can automatically generate code\ncompetitive to reference implementations. Further, we show that dynamically\ndetermining the data layout based on intrinsic and workload is beneficial for\nhardware utilization and performance. In cases where the reference\nimplementation has low hardware utilization due to its fixed deployment\nstrategy, we achieve a geomean speedup of up to x2.813, while individual\noperators can improve as much as x170.", "time": "2021-08-26T06:29:56Z", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04731v4", "id": "2104.04731v4", "title": "Joint Program and Layout Transformations to enable Convolutional\n  Operators on Specialized Hardware based on Constraint Programming"}

Model\nselection needs further compound these resource challenges: users often need to\ncompare dozens of models with different hyper-parameters or neural\narchitectures to suit their specific task and dataset. In this paper, we\npresent Hydra, a system designed to tackle such challenges by enabling\nout-of-the-box scaling for multi-large-model DL workloads on even commodity\nGPUs in a resource-efficient manner. Hydra is the first approach to\nholistically optimize the execution of multi-model workloads for large DL\nmodels. We do this by adapting prior \"model-parallel\" execution schemes to work\nwith scalable parameter offloading across the memory hierarchy and further\nhybridizing this approach with task-parallel job scheduling techniques. Hydra\ndecouples scalability of model parameters from parallelism of execution, thus\nenabling DL users to train even a 6-billion parameter model on a single\ncommodity GPU. It also fully exploits the speedup potential of task parallelism\nin multi-GPU setups, yielding near-linear strong scaling and making rigorous\nmodel selection perhaps more practical for such models.

To solve such MDP, multi-agent reinforcement learning\n(MA-RL) algorithms along with domain-specific action space refining schemes are\ndeveloped, which online learn the delay-minimum forwarding paths to minimize\nthe model exchange latency between the edge devices (i.e., workers) and the\nremote server. To validate the proposed solutions, FedEdge is developed and\nimplemented, which is the first experimental framework in the literature for FL\nover multi-hop wireless edge computing networks. FedEdge allows us to fast\nprototype, deploy, and evaluate novel FL algorithms along with RL-based system\noptimization methods in real wireless devices. Moreover, a physical\nexperimental testbed is implemented by customizing the widely adopted Linux\nwireless routers and ML computing nodes.Finally, our experimentation results on\nthe testbed show that the proposed network-accelerated FL system can\npractically and significantly improve FL convergence speed, compared to the FL\nsystem empowered by the production-grade commercially available wireless\nnetworking protocol, BATMAN-Adv.", "time": "2022-05-31T13:45:32Z", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09410v4", "id": "2111.09410v4", "title": "EdgeML: Towards Network-Accelerated Federated Learning over Wireless\n  Edge"}

The proposed algorithm\nis built upon the RRT algorithm with a multi-tree structure. At the beginning,\nthe RRT algorithm is applied to find the initial solution based on partial\nknowledge of the environment. Then, the robot starts to execute this path. At\neach iteration, the new obstacle configurations are collected by the robot's\nsensor and used to replan the path. This new information can come from unknown\nstatic obstacles (e.g., seafloor layout) as well as moving obstacles. Then, to\naccommodate the environmental changes, two procedures are adopted: 1) edge\npruning, and 2) tree regrowing. Specifically, the edge pruning procedure checks\nthe collision status through the tree and only removes the invalid edges while\nmaintaining the tree structure of already-explored regions. Due to removal of\ninvalid edges, the tree could be broken into multiple disjoint trees. As such,\nthe RRT algorithm is applied to regrow the trees.

The algorithm also extends\nto the general $\\omega$-regular properties and runs in time polynomial in the\nsizes of the MDP as well as the LDBA.", "time": "2021-05-31T11:35:42Z", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14894v1", "id": "2105.14894v1", "title": "LTL-Constrained Steady-State Policy Synthesis"}

Traditionally, multi-sensor fusion methods\nsuch as the Extended Kalman Filter and Complementary Filter are employed to\nfuse the measurements from these sensors. However, these methods exhibit\nlimitations in accounting for the uncertainty, unpredictability, and dynamic\nnature of the motion in real-world situations. In this paper, the inertial\nsensors data are fed to the LSTM network which are then updated incrementally\nto incorporate the dynamic changes in motion occurring in the run time. The\nrobustness and efficiency of the proposed framework is demonstrated on the\ndataset collected from a commercially available inertial measurement unit. The\nproposed framework offers a significant improvement in the results compared to\nthe traditional method, even in the case of a highly dynamic environment. The\nLSTM framework-based attitude estimation approach can be deployed on a standard\nAI-supported processing module for real-time applications.", "time": "2021-08-04T09:03:53Z", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03173v1", "id": "2108.03173v1", "title": "Incremental learning of LSTM framework for sensor fusion in attitude\n  estimation"}

{"author": "Philipp Foehn, Angel Romero, Davide Scaramuzza", "abstract": "Quadrotors are among the most agile flying robots. However, planning\ntime-optimal trajectories at the actuation limit through multiple waypoints\nremains an open problem. This is crucial for applications such as inspection,\ndelivery, search and rescue, and drone racing. Early works used polynomial\ntrajectory formulations, which do not exploit the full actuator potential\nbecause of their inherent smoothness. Recent works resorted to numerical\noptimization but require waypoints to be allocated as costs or constraints at\nspecific discrete times. However, this time allocation is a priori unknown and\nrenders previous works incapable of producing truly time-optimal trajectories.\nTo generate truly time-optimal trajectories, we propose a solution to the time\nallocation problem while exploiting the full quadrotor's actuator potential. We\nachieve this by introducing a formulation of progress along the trajectory,\nwhich enables the simultaneous optimization of the time allocation and the\ntrajectory itself. We compare our method against related approaches and\nvalidate it in real-world flights in one of the world's largest motion-capture\nsystems, where we outperform human expert drone pilots in a drone-racing task.", "time": "2021-10-01T13:03:54Z", "link": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04537v3", "id": "2108.04537v3", "title": "Time-Optimal Planning for Quadrotor Waypoint Flight"}
